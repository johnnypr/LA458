<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi Class!</p>
  <p>My name is <b>Tressa Hobbs</b>. I am a senior in Anthropology and International Studies with minors in Classical Studies and GIS. I am on campus this semester. I don’t have any experience with coding in general or HTML/JavaScript but I am excited to learn. I have a decent amount of experience in GIS and am also currently taking CRP 351 and DSN 546. I’ve used GIS to map locations of artifacts and features discovered while working on an archaeological site and I will be using collector and web mapping this summer to document hiking trails in Iceland and will be helping make a web application for it. I hope to learn a lot about coding in this class and add to my current GIS skill set.</p>
